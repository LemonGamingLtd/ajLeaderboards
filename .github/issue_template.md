!!!   READ BEFORE CREATING A GITHUB ISSUE   !!!

GitHub Issues are not the place to get support. Before creating an issue, make sure you have talked to aj and agree that it is appropiate for a GitHub Issue.

Even if you are sure it is an issue with the plugin, it could still be a configuration issue.

GitHub Issues that have not been seen by aj before opening (and/or are not strictly about development) will be closed with the message "this is not the place to get support"
